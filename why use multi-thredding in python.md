comparison between **input/output (I/O) operations** and **CPU-bound computations** in the context of programming (especially relevant to Python and multi-threading):

---

### Input/Output (I/O) Operations

- **Definition:** Tasks where the program spends most of its time waiting for external resources, not the CPU.
- **Examples:**
  - Reading/writing files from/to disk
  - Network requests (downloading/uploading data)
  - Waiting for user input
  - Database queries
- **Bottleneck:** The speed of the external device or network, not the processor.
- **Parallelization:** Multi-threading is helpful here because while one thread waits for I/O, others can continue processing or waiting for their own I/O.
- **Python relevance:** The Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) has little impact, since threads mostly wait (are “blocked”) on I/O.

### CPU-bound Computations

- **Definition:** Tasks where the program spends most of its time doing calculations or data processing using the CPU.
- **Examples:**
  - Image or video processing
  - Data analysis/calculation-heavy algorithms
  - Mathematical simulations
  - Machine learning model training (if not offloaded to GPUs)
- **Bottleneck:** The speed of the CPU.
- **Parallelization:** Multi-threading in Python is **not** effective due to the GIL; true parallelism is limited. Use multi-processing (multiple processes) instead, or write performance-critical code in C/C++ or use libraries like NumPy that release the GIL.
- **Python relevance:** The GIL prevents multiple threads from executing Python bytecode in parallel in a single process, so threads don’t speed up CPU-bound tasks.

### Summary Table

| Aspect           | I/O-bound Operations         | CPU-bound Computations         |
|------------------|-----------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Main Wait Time   | On external resources       | On CPU                        |
| Bottleneck       | Disk, network, user input   | Processor                     |
| Python Threads   | Effective                   | Not effective                 |
| Python Processes | Sometimes overkill          | Effective                     |

**In short:**  
- Use threads for I/O-bound tasks in Python.  
- Use multiprocessing for CPU-bound tasks in Python.
